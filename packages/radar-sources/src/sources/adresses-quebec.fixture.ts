/**
 * REAL committed terrAPI / Adresses Québec FeatureCollection fixtures for the
 * adapter tests.
 *
 * NOTHING here is fabricated: both accessors return verbatim first-records
 * excerpts of the live terrAPI `municipalites/<code>/adresses?geometry=0`
 * responses, committed under the spike's `samples/` directory (the SAME bytes
 * the deterministic seed-ontology path reuses). The fixture only re-reads those
 * committed files so the RECUEIL adapter can be unit-tested against REAL bytes
 * with no network call.
 *
 *   - terrapi-adresses-salaberry.json  — Salaberry-de-Valleyfield (70052):
 *     "24 rue Paquette, …", "561 avenue de Grande-Île, …", "310 boulevard Pie-XII, …".
 *   - terrapi-adresses-beauharnois.json — Beauharnois (70022):
 *     "279 chemin Saint-Louis, …", "28 rue Trudeau, …", "568 2 rue Richard, …".
 *
 * The committed sample was fetched with `geometry=0`, so it carries NO geometry
 * coordinates and NO lot numbers (HONEST: the Adresse geom stays null downstream).
 *
 * BOOT-SAFETY: the reads are LAZY (deferred to first access, then memoized).
 * Importing this module — and therefore the @radar/sources barrel and anything
 * that re-exports it — performs NO filesystem access, so the production API can
 * boot without shipping the dev `_spikes/.../samples/` bytes. The read only
 * happens when a fixture value is actually requested (tests, sample-seeding).
